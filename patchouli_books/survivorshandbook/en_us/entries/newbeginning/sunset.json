A small shack built out of wood or stone is as good of a living space I can build with my own two hands as any other.$(br2)Of course, I can't expect such a rudimentary structure to last very long; it is something, at the very least.

I can build a base in the hills either on top of a mountain's plateau, or inside the mountains itself. A mountain base might also serve as a good 'watchtower' of sorts - really useful for looking out further if I plan to move somewhere else later."
